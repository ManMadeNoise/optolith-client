# Optolith Character Generator and Manager [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/elyukai/optolith-client.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.com/elyukai/optolith-client)

Welcome to the repository for Optolith, a desktop application for The Dark Eye 5th Edition. Nice to see you here! üëãüèª

## Install

You can download the app [here (German page)](http://www.ulisses-ebooks.de/product/209711) or here [here (English page)](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/220253) (same app on both pages). You'll get an installer for Windows and a DMG for Mac, both with Auto Update support. For Linux, you get an AppImage, which *should* support Auto Update but it doesnt seem to work currently.

It is available for Windows 7+ as well as for Linux (Ubuntu 12.04+, Fedora 21, Debian 8) and macOS 10.9+ x64.

## Goal

Optolith was built and is developed based on a few key criteria:

- A player should be able to create characters without additional cost.
- A player should take care of the more important parts of a character &ndash; the personality and background &ndash; instead of keeping track of prerequisites and AP.
- Creating a character should be as easy and as intuitive as possible to focus on the actual stats.

With those criteria in mind, we further enhance the app.
